//IMPORTANT NOTE: The static and dynamic motion constraint variants were autogenerated from a text template. To modify the constraint, modify the text template instead.
//Using code generators to generate these sorts of constraint variants can work around some of the limitations in compile time expressiveness-
//here, we avoid creating a bunch of duplicate math for the one and two body constraint cases which would have to be separately maintained.
//There are other cases where this is pushed even further. Within the engine, the dozens of contact constraint variants are generated by text templates.
//This isn't the most wonderful solution in terms of development experience or tooling, 
//but it maximizes performance and avoids the need for in-language turing complete metaprogramming, so I'm okay with it.

//Constraint descriptions provide an explicit mapping from the array-of-structures format to the internal array-of-structures-of-arrays format used by the solver.
//Note that there is a separate description for the one and two body case- constraint implementations take advantage of the lack of a second body to reduce data gathering requirements.
